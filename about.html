        <h2>What is the Toronto Living Guide?</h2>
        <p>
            The Toronto Living Guide is an interactive web map that is designed to provide information about the city's key infrastructure and resources. 
            The tool enables users to explore affordable housing sites, transit availability, public facilities, and safety centers in order to better understand Toronto's urban scene.
        </p>
        <p>
            By presenting this data in an interactive way, we aim to facilitate data-driven decision-making for residents, newcomers, policymakers, and urban planners 
            who want to learn about and improve the livability of the city.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this project?</h2>
        <p>
            As Toronto grows, affordability, accessibility, and infrastructure planning remain top-of-mind concerns. This web map provides a snapshot of key factors that influence urban living, including:
        </p>

        <h3>Affordable Housing Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
            Housing affordability is a major issue in Toronto, where housing costs are increasing, pushing individuals further away from the city center. 
            Users can locate available affordable housing sites and their proximity to essential services.
        </p>

        <h3>Public Services and Safety</h3>
        <p>
            It is important to know where health facilities, police stations, and public amenities are so that community health can be maintained. 
            Users can see these points in relation to neighborhoods and public transportation access through this map.
        </p>

        <h3>Transit and Mobility</h3>
        <p>
            Toronto's public transportation system is at the center of everyday life. This map includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subway lines and stations to highlight connectivity.</li>
            <li>Proximity between large services and transit hubs, so residents can plan their commute properly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
        <h3>1. Housing & Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
            With the shortage of affordable housing, residents are able to comprehend where developments take place and organize their living situation accordingly.
            Knowing where housing deserts are can inform future policy discussions on urban planning and development.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Planning Public Services</h3>
        <p>
            Access to health care facilities and safety equipment is vital to community health.
            Being able to visualize gaps in service distribution can determine areas that would be well-suited to additional public investment.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Facilitating Smarter Urban Planning</h3>
        <p>
            With transit access visualization, we can quantify how well areas are linked together.
            Housing, transit, and public service connection can reveal areas where city planning could be improved.
        </p>
